[IDE](//selenium.dev/selenium-ide) (Integrated Development Environment)
is an easy-to-use Chrome and Firefox extension that records a user's
actions in the browser using existing Selenium commands, 
with parameters defined by the context of each element. 
It provides an excellent way to learn Selenium syntax.
